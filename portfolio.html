        <h2> About me </h2>
        <p> A recent UC Santa Barbara graduate that majored in Geography with an emphasis in GIS. As a GIS major, I am fascinated by the collection, analysis and management of geographical data and the important role they play across technology, data analysis, and environmental sciences many of which align with my interests. I demonstrate outstanding proficiency in working collaboratively with others in order to curate innovative solutions to complex problems. I am enthusiastic about utilizing my skills and experiences to larger corporations where I will bring in significant impact.</p>
